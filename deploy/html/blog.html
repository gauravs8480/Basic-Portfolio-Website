            <h2>Learn Web Development - in fun way</h2>
  <br>
            <h3>What is web development?</h3>
        
            <p>
              Web development is the process of building websites and apps for
              the internet—or for a private network known as an intranet. Web
              developers bring the design and functionality of a website to
              life, writing code that determines things like style, layout, and
              interactivity. From the most simple, static web pages to social
              media platforms and apps; from e-commerce websites to content
              management systems (like WordPress)—all the tools we use via the
              internet have been built by web developers. There are three
              different types (or layers) of web development: The frontend, the
              backend, and database technology. Frontend development, otherwise
              known as client-side scripting, encompasses all the elements of a
              website that the user experiences directly. Things like layout,
              font, colors, menus, and contact forms are all powered by the
              frontend. Backend development, or server-side scripting, is all
              about what goes on behind the scenes. When you interact with a
              website in some way—for example, filling out a form and clicking
              “submit”—the frontend communicates this action to the backend. The
              backend responds by sending the relevant information to the
              frontend—for example, the code needed to display a message such as
              “Thank you for filling out this form”. The third layer comprises
              database technology. The database contains all the files and
              content that are necessary for a website to function, storing it
              in such a way that makes it easy to retrieve, organize, edit, and
              save. The frontend, backend, and database technology all work
              together to build and run a fully functional website or
              application. As such, these three layers form the foundation of
              web development.

            <!-- <h3>What does a web developer do?</h3>
  
            <p>
              Broadly speaking, web developers are responsible for building and
              maintaining websites and apps. This involves writing code,
              identifying and fixing bugs, and collaborating with key
              stakeholders and designers to ensure that the products they’re
              building meet the needs of both the business and the user.
              However, the exact role of the web developer varies depending on
              whether they specialize in frontend development, backend
              development, or the full stack.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Frontend developers implement all the visual and interactive
              elements of a website that the user sees. Based on wireframes and
              prototypes provided by the design team, they use languages such as
              HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to bring the website to life. This
              includes coding the layout, navigational elements such as buttons
              and scrollbars, images, color schemes, and forms—anything that’s
              displayed on the website. They’re also responsible for carrying
              out usability tests and fixing any bugs. <br />
              <br>
  
              Backend developers are responsible for building and maintaining
              the behind-the-scenes technology that powers the frontend.
              Essentially, backend developers write code which ensures that
              everything the frontend developer builds is fully functional.
              Typical backend development tasks include creating, integrating,
              and managing the database, building software using backend
              frameworks, and developing and deploying content management
              systems—to name just a few. Just like frontend developers, backend
              developers are also responsible for testing and debugging.<br />
              <br>
  
              Full stack developers are proficient in both the frontend and the
              backend. Typical tasks include developing frontend and backend
              software using languages such as Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, and
              JavaScript, creating and debugging database related queries, and
              generally overseeing web development projects. <br />
  <br>
              In short, web developers are the engineers of the World Wide Web,
              building all the different elements that make up a fully
              functional website or app. -->
